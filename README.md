# 👁️ DrishtiNet: AI-Powered Integrated Ocular & Neurological Screening for India 🇮🇳

---

## ⭐ Executive Summary: Bridging India's Invisible Diagnostic Divide

India faces a **dual epidemic of preventable blindness and undiagnosed neurological disorders**, impacting millions of lives and livelihoods. Over **15 million Indians are blind**, largely due to treatable causes like cataracts and refractive errors. At the same time, neurological diseases—ranging from diabetic neuropathy to early cognitive decline—remain largely undetected, especially in rural regions where access to specialists is minimal[1].

The retina, being an extension of the brain, offers a unique, non-invasive opportunity for early diagnosis of neurological risk—but this diagnostic frontier remains largely untapped at primary care levels.

**DrishtiNet** is a **frugal, AI-powered, integrated ecosystem** built to empower frontline health workers across India with precise and accessible ocular and neurological screening tools. By fusing innovative hardware and smart AI software, DrishtiNet uniquely bridges the gap between eye health and brain health, ensuring early detection, prompt referral, and continuity of care—all aligned with India's national digital health initiatives[2].

## 🚨 The Challenge: Why DrishtiNet Matters

- 🏘️ **Rural and underserved areas comprise 65%+ of India’s population**, where specialist access is severely limited[3]
- 👁️ **Millions suffer from untreated cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal diseases, leading to avoidable blindness**
- 🧠 **Neurological disorders remain silent killers, often diagnosed too late**
- 🚫 **High-cost bulky diagnostic equipment relegated to urban tertiary centers—out of reach for frontline workers**
- 🔄 **Separate, fragmented eye and brain screenings miss crucial neuro-ophthalmic interlinks**
- 💸 **Delayed diagnosis escalates treatment costs and irreversible disability**

DrishtiNet addresses these gaps with a **portable, integrated, and cost-effective solution** tailored for Indian realities.
